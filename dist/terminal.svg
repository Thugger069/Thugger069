    / No live organism can continue for long  \
    | to exist sanely under conditions of     |
    | absolute reality; even larks and        |
    | katydids are supposed, by some, to      |
    | dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by   |
    | itself against its hills, holding       |
    | darkness within; it had stood so for    |
    | eighty years and might stand for eighty |
    | more. Within, walls continued upright,  |
    | bricks met neatly, floors were firm,    |
    | and doors were sensibly shut; silence   |
    | lay steadily against the wood and stone |
    | of Hill House, and whatever walked      |
    | there, walked alone.                    |
    |                                         |
